          <p class= "backtext">This past summer of 2019 I spent 2 weeks at an all-girls coding camp learning how to develop and design web applications. At the end, we built a static website using HTML,CSS, and Javascipt. It was a super fun experience, and I made friends with a bunch of cool people!</p>

    <div class="back">
      <div class= "align">
          <p class= "backtext">Also during this summer, I taught yoga & meditation to middle schoolers and high schoolers as part of a summer camp. I was able to connect with them socially and spritually. Not only did this make a positive impact on their wellbeing, but I also felt refreshed after my lessons.</p>

    <div class="back">
      <div class= "align">
          <p class= "backtext">In October 2019 I attended my first ever hackathon! Created by NASA, the objective was to design a web application that would help solve any global challenge. My group came up with an application called SolSim, an educational and interactive solar system simulator in which a user can input parameters and the website will produce the desired system.</p>

    <div class="back">
      <div class= "align">
          <p class= "backtext">In the Introduction to Programming in Python course I'm taking this Fall 2019, we had a second project in which we were assigned to calculate edit distance using dynamic programming as well as recover the alignment. It was definitely one of the hardest projects we have had to do by far, and it took a lot of effort and research to complete it.</p>
